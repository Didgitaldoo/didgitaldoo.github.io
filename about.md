## About

Didgitaldoo is many things:

### Community

First of all, it is a community of enthusiasts at the intersection of didgeridoo and technology, blending traditional didgeridoo practices with cutting-edge technology. Members collaborate on various projects, from designing and building didgeridoos to sharing knowledge, software, and designs. 

The community embraces an open, collaborative approach, leveraging tools like computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D printing. It attracts a diverse group of people, including programmers, makers, musicians, and artists. We believe the community aspect is vital for fostering motivation, encouraging knowledge exchange, and—most importantly—having fun.

With active members across at least three continents and connections worldwide (except Antarctica), Didgitaldoo thrives through shared projects, collaborations, and friendships. It has no formal structure—no membership lists, constitution, or bank account. Instead, it exists as a dynamic network driven by creativity and collaboration.

### Didgelab

Didgelab is an open-source toolkit for the computer-aided design of didgeridoos. Inspired by <a href="https://www.didgeridoo-physik.de/">the work of Frank Geipel</a>. Didgelab is the swiss army knife for acoustical didgeridoo computation. It allows users to:

* Calculate the acoustic properties of a didgeridoo shape, such as its sound spectrum and toots.
* Design didgeridoo shapes with specific acoustic characteristics.
* Create acoustic copies of existing didgeridoos by extracting sound properties from a sample and generating a matching shape.

Didgelab is a powerful tool for anyone interested in exploring the science behind didgeridoo acoustics.

### Library

The library is a collection of open DIY didgeridoo shapes. We encourage everyone to publish his or her designs.

### Short history

It all started during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bored and stuck in lockdown, Jan from Germany stumbled upon a YouTube video about building didgeridoos. He bought an irrigation pipe from a hardware store and built his first instrument. Fascinated, he built more and soon discovered the work of <a href="https://www.didgeridoo-physik.de/">Frank Geipel</a>, who pioneered computer-aided design for didgeridoos.

Inspired, Jan began developing the Didgelab software. Around the same time, he 3D-printed his first didgeridoo following Andrea Ferroni’s <a href="https://www.windproject.it/open-didgeridoo/">Open Didgeridoo Project</a>. After publishing Didgelab as open source, Jan connected with people worldwide, which started the Didgitaldoo community.
