summary: Release of Didgelab 3
---

[Didgelab 3](https://github.com/Didgitaldoo/didge-lab) has officially been released! While version 2.0 served as an internal bridge, it was never publicly documented; as a result, the GitHub repository has leaped directly from the three-year-old version 1.0 to this major 3.0 milestone.

This release introduces significant improvements to stability, usability, and simulation depth:

* **Extensive Documentation**: [Completely overhauled](https://github.com/Didgitaldoo/didge-lab/blob/main/doc/README.md).
* **Modular Architecture**: The source code has been reorganized for better extensibility and future-proofing.
* **Advanced acoustic simulation**: Added [1D Finite Element Method]((https://github.com/Didgitaldoo/didge-lab/blob/main/doc/simulation_methods/acoustical_simulation/1d_fem.md)) alongside the existing [transmission line model](https://github.com/Didgitaldoo/didge-lab/blob/main/doc/simulation_methods/acoustical_simulation/transmission_line_model.md).
* **Robust Testing:** Integrated unit tests to ensure reliability and simplify community contributions.
* **Shapes:** Improved [KigaliShape](https://github.com/Didgitaldoo/didge-lab/blob/main/doc/examples/kigali_shape_parameters.ipynb)
* **Loss**: [Composite loss functions](https://github.com/Didgitaldoo/didge-lab/blob/main/doc/examples/loss/00_overview.ipynb)
