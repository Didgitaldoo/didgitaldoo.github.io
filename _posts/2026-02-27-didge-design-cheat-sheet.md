# Didgeridoo Design Cheat Sheet

This document gives a compact overview about didgeridoo design.

### **1\. Bore Geometry (The Shape)**

The internal shape is the "engine" of the instrument.

* **Cylindrical (Straight Pipe):**  
  * **Sound:** "Clean," "Pure," or "Electronic." It has very few overtones.  
  * **Characteristics:** The drone is stable but can sound "thin." Toots (overtones) are very high and difficult to reach.  
* **Conical (Tapered/Expanding):**  
  * **Sound:** "Rich," "Warm," and "Complex."  
  * **Characteristics:** The expanding shape creates many harmonic overtones. The toots are lower in pitch, making them easier to play and integrate into rhythms.

### **2\. Backpressure Logic**

Backpressure is the resistance that allows for circular breathing and lip control. Didgeridoos with high backpressure are easier to play than didgeridoos with low backpressure.

* **The Mouthpiece:** Should be **2.8 cm to 3.2 cm** in diameter. Anything larger than **3.5 cm** makes the drone difficult to hold.  
* **The "Neck" (The First 30 cm):** This is the most critical area. Keep this section narrow (approx. **3 cm to 4 cm**). If the bore expands too quickly here, you lose all backpressure.  
* **The Taper Rule:** A gradual expansion (conical) provides a better balance of backpressure and volume than a sudden "step" in diameter.  
* **Shape:** Conical didgeridoos have a higher back pressure than cylindrical didgeridoos  
* **Volume:** The larger the volume of the didgeridoo, the lower the back pressure. Shorter didgeridoos will have a higher back pressure than longer didgeridoos,.

### **3\. Wall Density & Thickness**

The walls must be rigid enough to reflect energy back into the air column.

* **Thin Walls:** Tend to vibrate *with* the air, absorbing energy. This makes the sound "dampened," "flimsy," or "muffled” because it takes away energy especially at high frequencies.  
* **Thick Walls (\> 1.0 cm):** Provide a "sturdy," crisp, and bright projection. Hardwoods (Eucalyptus, Oak, Ash) are superior to softwoods (Pine).  
* **Weight:** The thicker the wall, the heavier the didgeridoo.

### **4\. Internal Texture & Finish**

The "roughness" of the inside affects the "color" of the sound.

* **Smooth/Glassy Finish:** (Varnish or Epoxy). Creates a **fast, bright, and loud** sound. Preferred for modern, percussive playing.  
* **Rough/Natural Finish:** (Termite tracks or raw wood). Creates **micro-turbulence**. This results in a **haunting, raspy, and traditional** "earthy" tone.

### **5\. Bell Flare**

* **The Bell:** A flare at the end (expanding to **8 cm – 15 cm**) increases volume and bass response without sacrificing the backpressure managed at the top.

### **6\. Length**

* **Standard Rule:** If you want a lower key (like a deep B or A), you need more length. If you want a higher, faster key (like F or G), you need a shorter tube.  
* **Straight, conical pipes:** In a straight pipe, the relationship between length and pitch is linear. Cones need to be longer than cylinders to hit the same deep notes.  
* **The "Shortening" Effect of Conical Didgeridoos:** A strongly conical didgeridoo can actually play a deeper note than a cylinder of the exact same length.
