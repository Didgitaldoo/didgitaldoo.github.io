<h2> About Didgelabs </h2>
<p>DidgeLab, created by Jan Nehring, is a free toolkit for computing didgeridoo geometries. It offers acoustical
  simulation to compute
  resonant frequencies and computational evolution to design didgeridoo shapes with specific sonic properties.
  It provides powerful features for didgeridoo builders and researchers to explore the acoustics of didgeridoos and to
  design new
  instruments with specific sound properties.
