<br>
<p> - Didgelab </p>
<p>Developed by Jan Nehring, Didgelab is a free toolkit for computing didgeridoo geometries. It offers acoustical
  simulation to compute resonant frequencies and computational evolution to design didgeridoo shapes with specific sonic
  properties.

  It provides powerful features for didgeridoo builders and researchers to explore the acoustics of didgeridoos and to
  design new instruments with specific sound properties.
