<h2>About</h2>

<p>Didgitaldoo is many things:</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>
    First of all, it is a community of enthusiasts at the intersection of didgeridoo and technology. As a community we
    do projects together, e.g., we design and build didgeridoos together. Generally, we follow an open approach and try
    to share designs, knowledge, software and more. The community revolves around didgeridoos and technologies, such as
    computer aided design, 3d-printing and more. We believe that the community aspect is very important for motivation,
    knowledge sharing and, most important, having fun. The community has active members in at least three continents,
    with connections to all continents except Antarctica. The community does not have clearly defined inside and
    outside, it does not have a members list, a constitution or a bank account. Instead, it
    lives through the projects, collaborations and friendships of its members.

<h3>Didgelab</h3>

<p>
    The open source software Didgelab is a toolkit for computer aided design of didgeridoos. It is inspired by / copied
    from <a href="https://www.didgeridoo-physik.de/">the work of Frank Geipel</a>. Didgelab is the swiss army knife for acoustical didgeridoo computation. It can compute acoustic properties of a didgeridoo shape, such as sound spectrum and toots. Also, it can compute didgeridoo shapes with specific acoustic properties. Also, it can create an acoustic copy: First it extracts the acoustic properties of a didgeridoo from a sound sample. Then, Didgelab finds a shape that produces this sound.

<h3>Library</h3>

<p>
    The library is a collection of open DIY didgeridoo shapes. We encourage everyone to publish his or her designs.

<h3>Short history</h3>
<p>
    Inspired by a Youtube video and the boredom of COVID19, curfews and social distancing, Jan from Germany bought an
    irrigation pipe in the hardware store and built his first Didgeridoo. He spend a lot of time with his new
    instrument, built more Didgeridoos and disovered the works of <a href="https://www.didgeridoo-physik.de/">Frank
        Geipel</a>, who invented a technology for computer-aided design of didgeridoos. Shortly after, Jan started to
    program the Didgelab software. At the same time, Jan build his first Didgeridoo using a 3d printer, after Andrea
    Ferroni's <a href="https://www.windproject.it/open-didgeridoo/">Open Didgeridoo</a>. Published the Didgelab software
    on GitHub started contacts with people from all over the world, which started the Didgitaldoo community.
